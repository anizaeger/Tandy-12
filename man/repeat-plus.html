	<b>Game 8: Repeat Plus (for two or more players)</b>
	<p>This is similar to game 3 except that a player adds<br />
	one more note after repeating the sequence of notes<br />
	entered by the previous player.  The Computer starts the<br />
	game with a single note; the first player must press<br />
	that key, plus one more.  Then the second player presses<br />
	the first two and adds one more note.  (The Computer<br />
	sounds a short beep to tell the next player it is his or<br />
	her turn).  The third player (or back to the first<br />
	player) repeats the sequence and adds one more.  So the<br />
	game continues until one of the player makes a mistake.</p>
