	<b>Game 10: Compete</b>
	<p>In this game two players check their reaction time<br />
	against each other.  One player is assigned buttons<br />
	1, 2, 3, and 4; the other player has 9, 10, 11, and 12.<br />
	Press START to start the game.  The Computer will flash<br />
	5, 6, 7, and 8 for a short time, and then stop on one of<br />
	these numbers.  The players must press their button next<br />
	to the stopped light.  The quickest player wins.  If one<br />
	player makes a mistake, the other player is given a<br />
	point.  The first player with 5 points wins - the<br />
	Computer will flash that player's buttons to show the<br />
	winner.</p>
